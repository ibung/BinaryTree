Project Description
This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) Abstract Data Type (ADT) in C programming language. The implementation provides fundamental operations for working with binary trees using an iterative approach (non-recursive).
Features
The Binary Tree ADT supports the following operations:

Search Node - Searches for a node with a specific value in the binary tree
Tree Height - Calculates the maximum depth/height of the binary tree
Node Count - Counts the total number of nodes present in the binary tree
Insert Node - Adds a new node with specified value to the binary tree
Maximum Node - Finds the node with the maximum value in the binary tree

Implementation Details
The implementation follows good software engineering practices:

Modular Design: Separates interface (header file) from implementation
Memory Management: Properly allocates and frees memory to prevent leaks
Iterative Approach: All operations are implemented iteratively without recursion
User Interface: Interactive menu system for easy testing and demonstration

Project Structure

BinaryTree.h - Header file containing data structures and function declarations
BinaryTree.c - Implementation file with the core BST algorithms
main.c - Main program with user interface for interacting with the BST

Compilation
The project can be compiled using GCC:
gcc -o tes main.c BinaryTree.c
Usage
After compilation, run the executable:
./tes
Use the interactive menu to perform operations on the binary tree:

Insert nodes to build your tree
Search for specific values
Calculate the height of the tree
Count the number of nodes
Find the maximum value

Academic Purpose
This implementation was created as part of the Data Structure and Algorithm course assignment at Bandung State Polytechnic (Politeknik Negeri Bandung). The focus was on understanding tree data structures, particularly Binary Search Trees, and implementing common operations without using recursion.
